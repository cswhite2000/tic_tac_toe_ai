# tic_tac_toe_ai
Tic Tac Toe powered by a sklearn MLPClassifier

csv with all possible board states and the corresponding best move was generated with the java code

The Neural Network was trained on google colab using the generated csv

python code uses the archived MLP to make the decisions

sklearn must be installed for this to work

Just run the python/tictactoe.py file to test this out
